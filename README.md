Hosted at: [https://lolobq.github.io/Personal-Website/#/](https://lolobq.github.io/Personal-Website/#/)

This is a personal website I built using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) that deploys for free using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Pages
I created 5 main pages: home, about me, resume, projects, and contact.

Home: Contains a picture of me and a small introduction to the website.

About Me: Contains an introduction paragraph about what I'm currently doing, a recent picture of me, a brief history of my life, and a deeper dive into my personal interests.

Resume: Contains a link to the PDF of my resume, my educational and work experiences, skills, and relevant coursework.

Projects: Contains a running list of the projects I've created in my free time.

Contact: Contains a link to a contact form and links to my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles.
